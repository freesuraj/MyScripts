I intent to put several scripts that help my programming life easier over here.


### iconsCreator.sh
For iOS apps, app icon is required to be in 10-15 different sizes to support different devices. It'd be quite frustrating if you had to manually edit icons to have different sizes. 
`iconsCreator.sh` helps you with that. You'd need to install [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php), a command line tool to edit image first.

#### Usage:

Install `imagemagick`

```brew install imagemagick```

Run iconsCreator

```~/.iconsCreator BigIcon.png```

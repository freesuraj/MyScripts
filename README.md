I intent to put several scripts that help my programming life easier over here.


### imagemagic.sh
For iOS apps, app icon is required to be in 10-15 different sizes to support different devices. It'd be quite frustrating if you had to manually edit icons to have different sizes. 
`imagemagic.sh` helps you with that. You'd need to install `imagemagic`, a command line tool to edit image first.
Usage:
		~/.imagemagic.sh BigIcon.png
